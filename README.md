# SeleniumYoutube

This is a personal practice project of using Selenium with Python to run basic quality assurance tests on the website.

Due to the nature of being a third party with no special access, there are certain features that I cannot access with a simple dummy account.

Outside of Selenium and Pytest, there are no other Python packages that need to be installed.
